# Decentraland Electron Client
An standalone client for the Decentraland Network

This is essentially the Decentraland website within an electron container with some CSS injected and discord RPC support

## Why did you do this?
I did this because decentraland doesn't work correctly on firefox at the moment, and I didn't want to use chrome since it's annoying switching between browsers for things such as lastpass, adblock and other things. So instead I created an standalone client on electron which worked really well for me.

Feel free to fork and make changes and build on this.
It's MIT Licence anyway.

## Notes

This seems to be an old build, there is a newer build on my computer which I'll push when I next get home and remember.

Just a heads up, some of the code is isn't very good, and I implemented some hacky ideas to get around some issues I had.
