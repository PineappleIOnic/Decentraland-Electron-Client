# Decentraland Electron Client

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/PineappleIOnic/Decentraland-Electron-Client.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

An electron client for the Decentraland Network

This is essentially the Decentraland website within an electron container with some CSS injected and discord RPC support

## Why did you do this?
I did this because decentraland doesn't work correctly on firefox at the time, and I didn't want to use chrome since it's annoying switching between browsers for things such as lastpass, adblock and other things. So instead I created an standalone client on electron which worked really well for me.

Feel free to fork and make changes and build on this.
It's MIT Licence anyway.
